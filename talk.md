# Welcome to Bristol Clojure Dojo

This month, we'll do things differently

- Absolute beginners: Clojurescript tutorial for Light Table
- Beginners: 4clojure exercises
- Others: work through and discuss the Om tutorials

---

# Absolute beginners

- Go to [lighttable.com](http://lighttable.com) and download the Light Table IDE
- Go to the [Clojurescript tutorial](http://github.com/swannodette/lt-cljs-tutorial) and open it in Light Table

---

# Beginners

- Work through the problems at [4clojure.com](http://www.4clojure.com/)
- Help each other out

---

# Intermediate/adventurous people

- We'll be working through the [Om tutorial](https://github.com/swannodette/om/wiki/Basic-Tutorial).
- It's still a little experimental, so expect things to break!

---

# Advanced

If you've already done the tutorials:

- Try making something!
- Take a look at the [TodoMVC](https://github.com/swannodette/todomvc/tree/gh-pages/labs/architecture-examples/om) for inspiration

---

# Brief intro to Om

- Based on Facebook's React library
- React redraws the DOM using diffs
- Modular, composable UI components
- React: mutable, Om: Immutable
- Om adds lazy evaluation for amazing performance
